## Description:
 The objective of this application is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The following acceptance criteria were kept in mind when developing this application:

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```

## Installation:
 The code can be downloaded via the Note Taker folder on my Github page.

## Usage:
  This Note Taker application is intended for easy navigation by using deployed webpage.
  
  Alternatively, the user can download the files on the Note Taker Github repository, running 'npm install' in the command line in the installed directory, and then running 'npm run start'. The user can then access the application on their localhost:3001 webpage.
